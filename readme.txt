this theme is made for you. Whether you are a simple blogger,
a writer, a journalist or an intellectual, Marianne will delight you…
and your readers.

== Description ==
The design of Marianne is sober and modern, without frills.
The small width of its pages and the absence of visual pollution
(excess of colors and icons) facilitate the reading and emphasize
the essential, your contents, for the greatest pleasure of your readers.

Marianne uses the system fonts. In concrete terms, it does not load
new files to display your texts and thus gains in speed. In addition,
the use of such fonts brings an appreciable graphic continuity
to your digital ecosystem.

This is a customizable theme. You can add a logo, switch from a light
to a dark color scheme, change the font, add links to your social accounts
and more… It’s up to you!
