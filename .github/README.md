**Marianne.**

A minimalist theme ideal for writers, journalists and all bloggers who want to share their texts.

Marianne is a minimalist, readable, fast and flexible theme.

Its design is sober and modern, without frills. The small width of its pages and the absence of visual pollution (excess of colors and icons) facilitate the reading and emphasize the essential, your contents, for the greatest pleasure of your readers.

Marianne uses the system fonts. In concrete terms, it does not load new files to display your texts and thus gains in speed. In addition, the use of such fonts brings an appreciable graphic continuity to your digital ecosystem.
